Building Haxe from source
=======

Obtaining the source
-------

The Haxe compiler sources are hosted on GitHub under the [HaxeFoundation account](http://github.com/HaxeFoundation). The [Haxe repository](http://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe) has several submodules, so cloning it should be done with the `--recursive` flag like so:

```
git clone --recursive git://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe.git
```

Alternatively, source .zip archives or tarballs can be obtained from the [GitHub Haxe release overview](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/releases).
