# Jobs and Services

The Haxe Foundation intends to supply a forum for employers to advertise Haxe developer positions they have available, and also to advertise consulting / training services provided by members of the community.

Until this is ready, we encourage you to post to our <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/haxelang?hl=en">community mailing list</a> with any opportunities you wish to share.
